<b>Bug Report:</b> <a href="https://github.com/cjdduarte/Disconnected_Review_Log_Cleaner/issues">https://github.com/cjdduarte/Disconnected_Review_Log_Cleaner/issues</a>

<b>#### Description:</b>

The Disconnected Review Log Cleaner add-on is crafted to address and remove those stray review log entries that accumulate in the database over time. Deleting a card occasionally leads to certain review histories becoming disconnected, meaning they're no longer linked to any active card. With this tool, such disconnected review histories are identified and removed, ensuring a tidier database.

<b>Usage:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Navigate to the Tools menu in Anki</li>
  <li>Select "Clean Disconnected Review Logs"</li>
  <li>Confirm the prompt to delete the disconnected review log entries.</li>
</ul>

<b>Note:</b>

After deletion, a full synchronization is recommended if you use Anki on multiple devices.
